NTFS ISO List Generation Plugin (by CaptainCPS-X, 2013)
---------------------------------------------------------

This "plugin" was made as a way to interface between 
the NTFS library originally compiled with PSL1GHT and
my application core which is a SCE SDK / OpenGL project.

If the NTFS library is linked directly to a SCE SDK project
the compiler will throw a great list of unreferenced 
stuff, as expected.

Finally, the main reason to do this plugin, is basically 
because I do not have experience working on PSL1GHT
graphic libraries and honestly would take me some time
to get used to it. So at least until that day come
I will keep programming for SCE SDK / OpenGL.

--------------------------------------------------------

To compile just edit the .BAT files with your system values
and run them.

- Thanks to Estwald for the NTFS original library.
- Thanks to "Cobra Dev" for improving the NTFS library and 
releasing the code.
